   ```
3. **Create Tables:**

   - **Patients Table:**
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE patients (
         id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
         name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
         age INT NOT NULL,
         gender VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL
     );
     ```
   - **Doctors Table:**
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE doctors (
         id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
         name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
         specialty VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
     );
     ```
   - **Appointments Table:**
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE appointments (
         id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
         patient_id INT NOT NULL,
         doctor_id INT NOT NULL,
         appointment_date DATE NOT NULL,
         FOREIGN KEY (patient_id) REFERENCES patients(id),
         FOREIGN KEY (doctor_id) REFERENCES doctors(id)
     );
     ```

## How to Run

1. **Clone or Download the Project.**
2. **Add MySQL Connector/J:**
   - Place the `.jar` file in a `lib` folder in your project directory.
   - Add the `.jar` file to the project classpath.
3. **Update Database Credentials:**
   - Modify the following fields in the `HospitalManagement` class:
     ```java
     private static final String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/hospital";
     private static final String username = "your_mysql_username";
     private static final String password = "your_mysql_password";
     ```
4. **Compile and Run:**
   ```bash
   javac -cp ".;lib/mysql-connector-j-9.1.0.jar" src/*.java
   java -cp ".;lib/mysql-connector-j-9.1.0.jar;src" HospitalManagement
   ```

## Learning Objectives

1. **JDBC Connection:** Understand how to connect Java with MySQL using JDBC.
2. **CRUD Operations:** Learn to perform basic CRUD operations on a database.
3. **Prepared Statements:** Avoid SQL injection and handle dynamic queries securely.
4. **Modular Programming:** Separate concerns using different classes for patients, doctors, and main operations.

## Limitations

- Basic validation is implemented; further checks can be added.
- No GUI; this is a console-based application.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add more features like patient and doctor search, updating records, and deleting records.
- Introduce a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user interaction.
- Implement advanced appointment scheduling features.
